----------Exceptions---------
Errors
-------
1.Compile Time Error -- during compile Time error shows in Terminal (Syntactical Errors)
2.Logical Error -- (2+2) = 5 (bugs/logical errors)
3.RunTime Error -- File/code Missing from system (we need to Handle such type of Errors through Exceptions)

keywords:
try -- checks logic
catch -- catch/handles the exceptions
throw -- used to throw an exception manually. (Eg: if database connection fails it will throw server error or handle by connecting to new connection)
throws -- declare exceptions a method can throw
finally -- runs always(even though exception occurs or not) also use to close files

try-with-resource -- shorten the try-finally it will close files or connc automatically. no need of finally to close files
